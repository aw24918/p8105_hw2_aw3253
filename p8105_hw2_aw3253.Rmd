## Importing data (Problem 0)

I am importing data for Problems 1-2.

```{r}

babies_df = 
  read_csv("data/popular_baby_names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

trash_df = 
  read_excel("data/trash_wheel.xlsx") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

```




# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
